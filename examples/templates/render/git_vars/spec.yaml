desc: 'An example of using builtin git variables in a template'

steps:
  - desc: 'Include an empty file that we can append to'
    action: 'include'
    params:
      paths: ['out.txt']
  - desc: 'Print a message if being rendered from git'

        This template is rendered from git. The git short SHA is
        {{._git_short_sha}} and the full SHA is {{._git_sha}}.
  - desc: 'Print the git tag if there is one'
    action: 'append'
    if: '_git_tag != ""'
    params:
      paths: ['out.txt']
      with: |-
        And furthermore, the git tag associated with that SHA is {{._git_tag}}.
  - desc: "If we're rendering from git and there's no tag, then say that"
    action: 'append'
    if: '_git_sha != "" && _git_tag == ""'
    params:
      paths: ['out.txt']
      with: |-
        There isn't a tag pointing to this SHA.

  - desc: 'Print a message if NOT being rendered from git'
    action: 'append'
    if: '_git_sha == ""'
    params:
      paths: ['out.txt']
      with: |-
        This template isn't being rendered from git, so there's no SHA or tag.
