# Template: Flutter Template

This template was bootstrapped with [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli)
and [BLoC](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)

## Set up instruction

1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

1. Create an empty repository. 

1. Navigate to the root of your repository.

1. Then run the following command.

    ```
    abc templates render \
      -input=auth0_domain='AUTH0_DOMAIN' \
      -input=auth0_client_id='AUTH0_CLIENT_ID' \
      -input=auth0_url_scheme='AUTH0_URL_SCHEME' \
      github.com/abcxyz/abc/t/flutter_template@latest
    ```

1. You should now have a copy of Flutter boilerplate in your repository.

1. Run `flutter analyze` to analyze source code.

1. Run `flutter test` to run tests

1. Run `flutter run` to start the application in browser, mobile emulator
or real devices.
