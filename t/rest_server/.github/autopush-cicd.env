# The variables in this file will be made accessible in all workflow jobs via
# the GITHUB_ENV environment file, as explained at
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-environment-variable.
# 
# These variables should be accessed in workflow files via the GitHub env
# context, for example `${{ env.VARIABLE }}`.
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#env-context
# 
# Do not quote the values of the variables in this file.
# 
# Variables in this file can be defined using other variables in this file
# because interpolation happens at the time of use, not the time when they are
# added to the GITHUB_ENV file. This can be done by directly accessing the other
# variable via the shell's environment (not the GitHub env context); for
# example, `VARIABLE_2=${VARIABLE_1}`. Note that this is undocumented behavior
# that depends on the GitHub runner's shell and it could break in the future.
