# abc

**abc is not an official Google product.**

abc is a command line interface (CLI) to speed up the process of creating new
applications. It achieves this by using a templating system that will allow
users to interactively fork existing repos, while providing neccessary context,
instructions, or requested inputs.

Using this tool will reduce the cognitive load required to set up GitHub actions
properly, or follow development best practices, and avoid copy/pasting from
various sources to start a new project.
